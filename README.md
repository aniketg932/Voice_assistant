We thought it would be cool to create a personal assistant in Python. If you are into movies you may have heard of Jarvis, an A.I. based character in the Iron Man films.
The features that were already included in this project:--
  ●Recognize spoken voice (Speech recognition).
  ●Answer in spoken voice (Text to speech).
  ●Answer simple commands.

Virtual desktop assistants are an awesome thing. If you want your machine to run on your command like Jarvis - did for Tony. 
Yes it is possible. It is possible using Python. Python offers a good major library so that we can use it for making a virtual assistant. 
Windows has Sapi5 and Linux has Espeak which can help us in having the voice from our machine. It is a weak A.I
